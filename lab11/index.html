                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>The challenge of this lab is to experiment with JavaScript events by taking user input from a form field, modifying it using JavaScript and displaying the result using jQuery.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>The main problem we had in doing this lab was actually having the functions show up in the webpage. We debugged it by fixing the structure and syntax of the code.</p>
            </div>

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>We did this lab in a short amount of time. We worked in person together to help each other and discuss any mistakes we made along the way.</p>
