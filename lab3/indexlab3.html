        <h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
        <p>This lab required us to strengthen the local files on our computers and to add index.html files. 
            </p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>At first, it was challenging to focus on this lab. We realized we were hungry and got some food and then we were able to focus. </p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>We successfully created an index.html file within the file structure.</p>
