		<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>

		    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>To systematically identify, test, and fix problems in your past JavaScript labs, using browser tools like the JavaScript console, and to reflect on your debugging process.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="minor-section">
            <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>There were no problems with this lab because we didn't have anything to debug.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="minor-section">
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>We worked on this assignment in person and it went very quickly because we did everything correctly.</p>

        <div class="minor-section">
			<h2>Debugging</h2>
                <p>I went through all of my previous JavaScript labs and tested them using my browser and the JavaScript console. I didn't find any bugs or unexpected behavior in my code. To be thorough, I opened each lab file, ran the code, and checked the console for any errors or warnings. I also added comments and cleaned up the code style where needed (indentation, spacing, etc.).</p>
