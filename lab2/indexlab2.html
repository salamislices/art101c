    <h1>Hello World</h1>

    <p>Hello, I am Daniel, and my pronouns are he/him, and this is my lab 2 writing. I am a 2nd-year AGPM major, and I am super psyched about this class. I am working with Charlise, and her pronouns are she/her. She is a 1st-year psychology major and we worked on this assignment at the library. Specifically the McHenry library. She loves music, dancing, singing, and drawing. </p>
